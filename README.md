## Sensors we plan to use:
- [ ] External Temperature
- [ ] Soil Temperature (to show that our system keeps the temperature stable w.r.t. the external temperature)
- [ ] External humidity
- [ ] Soil moisture (to show that our system keeps the moisture stable w.r.t. the external humidity)
- [ ] Light sensor to protect a specific plant from too much light and to alert the user if the plant is not receiving enough light
- [ ] Ph soil sensor (to alert the user if the soil is too acidic or too basic w.r.t. the specific plant's needs)
- [ ] Water tank level (to check if the user needs to refill it)

## Features we plan to implement:
- [ ] Automatic watering system
- [ ] Automatic temperature control
- [ ] LED system to alert low level of the water tank
- [ ] Notifications to the user if the plant needs more light
- [ ] Automatic mini-roof to protect the plant from too much light (270Â°)
